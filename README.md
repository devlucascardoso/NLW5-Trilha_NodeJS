## About this Project

This project was developed during the NodeJS path in the fifth edition of NLW (Next Level Week). We use concepts about what an API is, starting a project using Typescript and Express for route management.

This project is part of my personal portfolio, so, I'll be happy if you could provide me any feedback about the project, code, structure or anything that you can report that could make me a better developer!

Also, you can use this Project as you wish, be for study, be for make improvements or earn money with it!

It's free!
